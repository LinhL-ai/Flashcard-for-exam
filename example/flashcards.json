    "question": "How would you interpret the next step in a Thompson Sampling example using Beta charts?",
    "answer": "In a Thompson Sampling example, the next step involves sampling from the Beta distribution of each arm to determine which arm to pull next. The arm with the highest sampled value is chosen, and its distribution is updated based on the observed reward. This process iteratively refines the estimates of each arm's reward potential.",

    "question": "What are the practical applications of multi-armed bandits in business?",
    "answer": "Multi-armed bandits are used in digital environments like e-commerce and online advertising to optimize decisions in real-time. They are effective in settings where conditions change frequently, allowing businesses to allocate resources to the best-performing options, such as ad creatives or pricing strategies, based on user behavior and performance metrics.",

    "question": "What is a potential drawback of the Epsilon-Greedy strategy?",
    "answer": "A drawback of the Epsilon-Greedy strategy is that it requires a fixed exploration probability (epsilon), which may not adapt well to changing environments. This can lead to suboptimal performance if the chosen epsilon is not suitable for the problem's dynamics, potentially resulting in either too much exploration or insufficient exploration.",

    "question": "In the Adler Mannheim case, how is Thompson Sampling used to optimize ad performance?",
    "answer": "In the Adler Mannheim case, Thompson Sampling is used to optimize ad performance by treating each ad type (action-focused, star close-up, family experience) as an arm. The algorithm samples from each ad's Beta distribution to decide which ad to show, updating the distribution based on whether the ad was clicked (reward = 1) or not (reward = 0).",

    "question": "What is an artificial neural network (ANN)?",
    "answer": "An artificial neural network (ANN) is a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the brain process information. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers: input, hidden, and output layers. Each connection (edge) represents the flow of data, with the hidden layers performing transformations on the input data to produce an output.",

  {
    "question": "How do biological neurons compare to artificial neurons?",
    "answer": "Biological neurons are the fundamental units of the brain that receive sensory input, transform signals, and send them to other neurons or muscles. Similarly, artificial neurons receive input, transform it using a mathematical function, and produce an output. Both types of neurons are designed to process and transmit information, but artificial neurons do so using mathematical functions.",

    "question": "What is deep learning and how does it relate to artificial neural networks?",
    "answer": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with many layers (deep networks) to model complex patterns in data. It leverages the architecture of ANNs to perform tasks such as image and speech recognition, where traditional algorithms may struggle.",

    "question": "What are the key components of an artificial neural network?",
    "answer": "The key components of an artificial neural network include: 1) Input layer, which receives the data; 2) Hidden layers, which perform transformations and computations on the data; 3) Output layer, which produces the final result. Each layer consists of nodes (neurons) that are interconnected, allowing data to flow through the network.",

  {
    "question": "How does an artificial neuron process information?",
    "answer": "An artificial neuron processes information by receiving input values, applying a mathematical function (activation function) to these inputs, and producing an output. The function often includes weights and biases that are adjusted during training to improve the model's accuracy.",

    "question": "What is the significance of the activation function in an artificial neuron?",
    "answer": "The activation function in an artificial neuron determines the output of the neuron given an input or set of inputs. It introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing the network to learn complex patterns. Common activation functions include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh.",

  {
    "question": "How is training performed in an artificial neural network?",
